        The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye,
        Saturn has been known since ancient times.

        The planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was

        With an equatorial diameter of about 74,897 miles, Saturn is 9 times

        Saturn orbits the sun from an average distance of 886 million miles,
        From this distance, it takes sunlight 80 minutes to travel from the Sun
        to Saturn.

        Saturn has the second-shortest day in the solar system, One day on
        Saturn takes only 10.7 hours (the time it takes for Saturn to rotate or
        spin around once).

        While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Saturn, it wouldn't be
        able to fly through unscathed either, the extreme pressures and
        temperatures deep inside the planet would crush, melt, and vaporize any
        spacecraft trying to fly into the planet.
